# boulder-news
A fake news site dedicated to the art of bouldering. Course work for a web application development course in Java.

Deployment automatically through Travis: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sainikumara/boulder-news.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sainikumara/boulder-news)

The application is running in https://boulder-news.herokuapp.com/.
Unfortunately some features that work locally are broken in production. On my TODO-list.
